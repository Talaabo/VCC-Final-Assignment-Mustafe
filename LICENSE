I choose the MIT license for my projects because of its simplicity and permissiveness. 
The MIT license allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute my software for any purpose, 
including commercial use, without requiring them to open-source their derivative works. 
This aligns with my belief in fostering a collaborative and open-source community where 
developers can freely build upon each other's work. Additionally, the MIT license includes 
a disclaimer of liability, which helps protect me from any potential legal issues arising 
from the use of my software. Overall, the MIT license provides a balance between freedom 
and legal protection, making it an ideal choice for my projects.
